<!--
Ex: After the context object is ready
use getBean method to fetch both the beans in the xml
one lazy and one eager.
And verify from the logs that one of the beans is indeed lazy loaded
and another is indeed eager loaded

(ii) Add a default constructor in bothe the beans
and print a message inside it.
This way you will come to know when the constructor of a class is called.
