In the PhoneNumber class
we made a field called id and used a generator for it
It is a primary key that's generated sequentially.

remove this primary key and create a composite key
from (person_id,number)

Currently the phonenumber table that gets created has an extra column
id as a primary key.
After modification the table should not have this primary key
and should have a composite key = (person_id, number)

Hint:
Try putting @Id on both
private String number;
private Person person;
This will make both the fields part of the key.
And put an annotation @IdClass on top of the class.
