Ex:
Create two classes Person and Address. Person class has an address field
Use Constructor Injection to create Objects for Person and Address class
Use the @Bean annotation so that they are instantiated by IOC Container.
Make The Address Bean lazy my marking the method with annotation @Lazy
Verify if it is indeed getting initialized lazyly by putting logs inside the
constructor.

(i) The URL (ii) HTTP Method (iii) Request Body (iv) Response Body (v) Query Parameters

Ex :
Twitter HTTP APIs
Suppose if there 10k tweets. There will lot of network payload
which will result in delay
(i) Which can fetch tweets in batches of 100.
(ii) We also want the ability to fetch the tweets by data in ascending or descending order
(iii) API should be configurable and you can ask for say 100 , 200 tweets
(iv) Design the HTTP API call for the next button. Which will show the next
100 tweets
(v) Design the HTTP API call for the prev button. Which will show the prev
100 tweets
(vi) Design the HTTP API with the page number.
HTTP API should be able to fullfill all the above requirements.

Here you can intrepret the word show as return. So your API should
return say 100 tweets etc..
------
Return all tweets
Ex:
Facebook HTTP APIs
--------------------
1) User account creation
2) Follow another user
3) Friend another user
